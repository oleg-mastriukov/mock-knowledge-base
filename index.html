      <h2>Why you may receive multiple deliveries for one order</h2>
      <p>Some items ship from different locations or at different times. That’s why your order can arrive in separate deliveries.</p>
      <h3>What this means for you</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You may receive more than one package, even if you placed a single order.</li>
        <li>If one delivery is still on the way, the remaining items may be included there.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="note">
        <strong>Tip:</strong> If you’re missing an item, check whether another delivery for your order is still in transit.

      <h2>Delivery time for made-to-order home textiles</h2>
      <p>Some home textiles are prepared specifically for you (for example, custom sizing or special finishes). That means delivery can take longer than standard items.</p>
      <h3>What to expect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If your order contains both standard and made-to-order items, you may receive <strong>multiple deliveries</strong>.</li>
        <li>You’ll receive an update as soon as your delivery is on its way.</li>
